# BeatZip
A small application that allows PCVR users to zip all their songs in the song directory for uploading to the Oculus Quest version of Beat Saber

A HUGE thank you to Zingabopp and agc93 from the Beat Saber modding community discord for helping me accompish this by giving me advice on the matter. I am really grateful for your help.

**Known Issues**
		
	The application will crash when there is already a .zip file with the same name in the destination directory
	No file icon
	

If you experience issues you may ping me on the Beat Saber modding community discord or PM me directly from there. My username is "Arimodu"


I am releasing this as an open source project. If you want you may build on this, bugfix this, polish the code and whatever other stuff you may want to do. Make a branch and submit a pull request to pull to master and release.
