# BeatZip
A small application that allows PCVR users to zip all their songs in the song directory for uploading to the Oculus Quest version of Beat Saber

A HUGE thank you to Zingabopp and agc93 from the Beat Saber modding community discord for helping me accompish this by giving me advice on the matter. I am really grateful for your help.

**Known Issues**
		
	The application will crash when there is already a .zip file with the same name in the destination directory
